PREVIOUS PROJECTS
	tmercuri's Stars and Bacon were used, and ja11's Autocorrect was used

DESIGN
	The main data class is MapData, which contains everything integral to the operation of the map,
	such as the graph, the KD-tree, and the autocorrect.

	The graph search uses a modified A* search to find the shortest path, and the KD-tree is used
	to find nearest-neighbors when the inputs of a search are points before the graph is brought
	into play.

	For the command-line, the program simply instantiates a MapData with the given files, and then
	uses it to run searches, printing the results for each query.

	The GUI is based on a MapData as well, but uses a graphical front-end to access it. Four textfields
	are used to get streets and cross streets, as well as clocking on the map to get directions from
	the first clocked point to the second. The GUI uses extra MapData methods to access the graph
	in order to get Ways so that it can draw them.

	Whenever the GUI needs to do a path search, it uses the threads of an Executor to accomplish the
	task. Additionally, the GUI uses Executor threads for bringing in more points to draw as the
	user pans the view around.

OPTIMIZATIONS
	None.

TESTING
	You can run our system tests by running the command 'ant my_system_test' from the root directory.
	However, it seems that the testing script times out on our tests, because when it is run, it
	informs me that it got no output, but if I run the exact same arguments and input, I get the
	output that I was expecting. I do not know why this is or how to fix it.

	To be sure that our tests were accurate, we traced a path through the given data files, and then
	ran path searches on those points, making sure that the output path was what we expected it to be.

BUILDING
	To build, run 'ant'. To run, use 'bin/maps [--gui] <ways> <nodes> <index>'

BUGS
	Put simply, our GUI does not work. It is not complete, and does not function well. It can open an
	intial view, it can be panned and zoomed, but that is about it. Our command line interface works
	perfectly, but the GUI is far from perfect. We plan to have it complete and working for traffic, but
	for now that is it.
